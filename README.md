# Which Movie Streaming Service is the Best Fit for you?
## DSC106 Final Project - Mizuki Kadowaki 
Thanks to DVDs and VHS tapes, films, which used to be experienced only on the big screen made their way into people's homes. 
As technology further developed, movies continued to become more and more accessible through the internet and different streming services.
In the pandemic days, now more than ever, the demand for enjoying movies from the comfort of you home has skyrocketted, and with it, so have the number of streaming services. 

In this project, I have taken four popular streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+) and visualized their movie offerings so that one can determine which streaming service is best for them and their movie preferences.

The dataset I used is from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney

Limitations:
1. This only takes into consideration movie offerings and excludes other offerings that come with these platforms such as TV shows, the inclusion of Spotify with Hulu, Amazon Prime with Prime video etc. 
2. Movie offerings on these streaming platformes are constantly modified. This may not be the most up to date data.
